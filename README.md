# dezoomcamp-project

This is the final projet of [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)

## Problem description
Steam is a popular video game distribution platform. According to [Steam Usage and Catalog Stats for 2022](https://backlinko.com/steam-users) in 2022 had 120 million monthly active users, with more than half accessing to the platform at least once a day, which can give us information to analyse the popularity of a video game.   

This project aims to build an end-to-end pipeline that can facilitate data processing to analyse users reviews. It's defined as the first step for data exploration of steam users' reviews. 

## Dataset
[This](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souyama/steam-reviews) dataset have already extract information using the API for user reviews of about 50000+ games in Steam. 

As future projects, this dataset can be enriched by using Steam Web API to add more dimensions, such as information about games or users' friends.
